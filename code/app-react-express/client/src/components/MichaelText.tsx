      Michael contributed to this project in many ways including: UI design,
      connecting the backend server to the SQL database, and connecting the
      frontend and backend for certain features. He designed the navigation bar,
      the side panel in the about section, the screen sizes, and the containers
      needed for images and text to be displayed on the screen. Furthermore,
      Michael established the connection between the Express Node.js backend
      server and the SQL database that stores all of the user information.
