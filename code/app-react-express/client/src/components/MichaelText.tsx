      Michael's contributions spanned UI design, backend development, and
      bridging frontend and backend functionalities. Michael created the UI
      elements, including the navigation bar, the side panel in the About
      section, and tailored screen sizes and containers for seamless content
      display in all pages. In addition, Michael orchestrated the integration
      between the Express Node.js backend server and the SQL database, where
      user data resides. Michael also helped in connecting frontend components
      to the backend server by implementing post filtering functionalities,
      showcased in the search bars on the Posts page. Moreover, Michael
      established routing mechanisms between different pages, seamlessly
      connecting them as navigated through the navigation bar. His comprehensive
      involvement in the creation and design of this website enriched the
      project's functionality and user experience.
