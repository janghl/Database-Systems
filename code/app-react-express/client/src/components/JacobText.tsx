      Jacob played a pivotal role in shaping our project's foundational
      structure and functionality. Jacob showcased his proficiency in SQL by
      crafting advanced queries, including stored transaction procedures and
      trigger events. These queries provided essential functionality for user
      interactions, such as login, logout, account creation, and friend
      management. Furthermore, Jacob demonstrated his technical abilities by
      being the first team member to figure out how to connect frontend
      components and backend data. He then inspired collaboration by sharing his
      techniques with the team. Jacob's contributions not only ensured the
      project's technical robustness but also facilitated knowledge sharing
      among team members, fostering collaboration and skill development.
