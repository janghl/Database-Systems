      Joe played a crucial role in improving the project's SQL infrastructure,
      focusing on debugging advanced queries, including stored transaction
      procedures and trigger events. These queries formed the backbone of
      essential user functionalities, such as login, logout, account creation,
      and friend management. Joe's debugging ensured the smooth operation of
      these critical components. In addition to his SQL work, Joe helped in
      bridging the gap between SQL queries and backend server functionality. He
      helped to facilitate the connection between these elements, ensuring
      seamless communication and data flow between the frontend and backend
      systems. Moreover, Joe demonstrated his development skills by creating the
      Create Post functionality, a key feature of the project. His contributions
      enhanced the project's functionality and usability.
