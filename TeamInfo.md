**Project Summary**

Our project is an online platform that will be designed for users to engage publicly with their music tastes through posting their brief ratings of music and artists. The website will function as both a social media platform, and a personal music rating repository. Users will be able to create their own personalized profiles, with the ability to provide crucial information on their musical tastes via Spotify and potentially Apple Music integration. Primarily speaking, through the Spotify API, users will be able to view their listening history from spotify, as well as any of their frequently listened to songs so that they can quickly and easily rate them. Furthermore, users will be able to interact with each other and engage in sharing their thoughts about different music through profile discovery and through existing connections. Through linking their Spotify account with their profile, users can quickly find their friends on our platform, or invite their friends to the platform. Additionally, users will be able to discover new people through a discovery hub, containing reviews and ratings from other people on the platform. Through this, users can like or respond to music critiques by other users, and they can follow other people if they are interested in seeing that person’s ratings more often. 


The primary functionality of the site will be through a simplistic rating page, where the user simply has to scroll through their listening history and click values on the scale of 5 stars for each song. This brevity and ease of access seen in the reviewing process is what makes our site unique and approachable for users, as nobody would sensibly want to write written reviews for all their songs and artists. This page will additionally contain a feed for listened-to artists, where artist ratings may also be pushed to the web server. Moreover, all of the data regarding the user’s ratings of songs can be used to provide search recommendations on the site and to tailor shown songs more carefully. With more data on the user’s opinions of music, better music recommendations can be provided to the user, allowing them to explore music that best fits their tastes based on genre and rating overlaps from other users. This feature is secondary to our intention of making the site a rating-oriented application, but it provides extra depth to our implementation that would make sense given the data we plan on collecting.
